👋 Hello, I'm Francesco, a part-time bartender and passionate programmer. Currently, I'm studying at the University of Greenwich, pursuing my degree. 

🎓 I'm in my second year of university, focusing on honing my programming skills. I'm proficient in Python, with experience in imperative programming, object-oriented programming (OOP), and functional programming. As part of my summer learning, I'm also exploring Java, Swift, and C#.

🚀 I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working as part of a team. I'm actively involved in the SynergySoluti0n organization, where we strive to create innovative projects.

💻 In my free time, I indulge in reading mangas and playing video games, which further fuels my passion for technology and storytelling.
